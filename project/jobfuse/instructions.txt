/*** CSS FILES ***/

All the css is compiled though compass, so don't edit any .css file, you will have to edit the .scss file instead and run the compass compiler. Read more about compass here http://compass-style.org/

- Imports
For all the pages you will need to import the global.css, then the page css style afterwards. Please don't try to combine all the files into one css because we are using a different media queries for each page(responsive design), so if you combine them all it will break all the media queries.

/*** JS FILES ***/

I'm using Foundation framework for the JS, using it for the retina images and modal. For IE compatibility you will require the rem.js and placeholders.js.

If you know grunt, I would recommend merging all js and creating a single one for production.

/*** A/B TEST ***/

If you would like to test the button color just include the class="orange" on your html, the default color is blue.

There's 2 description pages (description and description-full), one contains the right sidebar and the other is full page description.

If you would like to change any color on the website, you can easily do so on the global variables files(scss/framework/components/_global.scss)

/*** SEO ***/

I've used all the necessary html tags for SEO, now you need to make sure you target your keywords properly. If you still have access to bright marketing files. I would recommend taking a look and check our top keywords and ad groups, then create your SEO strategy from that. If you need more help with seo just let me know.
