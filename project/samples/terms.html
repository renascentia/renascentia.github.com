        <h4>DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
        <p>OUR SITE IS MADE AVAILABLE "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THERE IS NO GUARANTY OR ASSURANCE THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF OUR SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR USE, PERFORM AS DESCRIBED OR THAT OUR SITE IS ACCURATE, TIMELY, COMPLETE OR ERROR FREE AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON OUR SITE FOR ANY DECISIONS OR ACTIONS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT CHOOSE TO MAKE OR TAKE.

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING YOU HAVE APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS TO PROTECT AND SECURE YOUR EQUIPMENT, PROGRAMS AND INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU, NOT US, ARE ASSUMING ALL RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT MAY ARISE OR BE ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF OUR WEBSITE.</p>
        <p>OUR LIABILITY TO YOU IS LIMITED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, COST AND/OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR BASIS OF THE CLAIM AND WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING FROM USE OF OUR SITE OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO YOU.</p>
        <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THESE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. HOWEVER, IF ANY LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES OR LIABILITY IS PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY LAW, WE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO THE MAXIMUM LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS PERMITTED; HOWEVER, IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).</p>

        <h4>THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND WEBSITES</h4>
        <p>We have no control over, and no liability for any third party websites or materials. We work with a number of partners and affiliates whose Internet sites may be linked with the Site. Because neither we nor our Site has control over the content and performance of these partner and affiliate sites, we make no guarantees about the accuracy, currency, content, or quality of the information provided by such sites, and we assume no responsibility for unintended, objectionable, inaccurate, misleading, or unlawful content that may reside on those sites. Similarly, from time to time in connection with your use of the Site, you may have access to Content or websites that are owned by third parties ("Third Party Content"). You acknowledge and agree that we make no guarantees about, and assume no responsibility for, the accuracy, currency, content, or quality of Third Party Content, and that, unless expressly provided otherwise, these Terms of Use shall govern your use of any and all Third Party Content.</p>

        <h4>GOVERNING LAW</h4>
        <p>Our Terms of Use and your use of our Site shall be construed, governed by and enforced under the substantive laws of the State of California applicable to parties resident in and contracts made, executed and wholly performed within the State of California. You submit to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts situated in San Diego County, California, USA in all disputes arising out of or related to the use of the Site or Service and you will not object to jurisdiction or venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, inconvenient forum or otherwise. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to our Terms of Use.</p>

        <h4>INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h4>
        <p>You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of our Terms of Use, including, without limitation, with respect to unauthorized use of Samples.com proprietary assets, will cause irreparable injury to Samples.com, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and Samples.com would not have an adequate remedy at law.  You therefore agree that Samples.com shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of our Terms of Use.  Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that Samples.com post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to Samples.com to enforce any provision of our Terms of Use.</p>

        <h4>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h4>
        <p>You agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@samples.com">support@samples.com</a> for any dispute or controversy so as to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Site or Service that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitration will be conducted in the English language in the city of San Diego, California by a single neutral arbitrator.</p>
        <p>You agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  If for any reason this arbitration clause is unenforceable or inapplicable, both you and we agree, to the extent permissible by law, to waive any right to pursue any claims on a class action basis.  If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, void, or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate under this section will not apply and any controversy or claim must be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts in San Diego, California.</p>

        <h4>MISCELLANEOUS</h4>
        <p>The Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement you have with us regarding the subject matter and supersedes any and all prior and/or inconsistent understandings. Our Terms of Use cannot be modified except as set described herein or in a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of ours. No electronic or digital communication of any kind is to be construed as a â€˜writingâ€™ for purposes of amending or modifying our Terms of Use or the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder. The illegality, unenforceability or invalidity of any provision is severable and shall not affect or impair the rest of our Terms of Use. No waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms of Use shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
